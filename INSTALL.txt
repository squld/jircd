INSTALLATION
============


Build
-----

You will need:
 - Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)

1) Run Ant.


Run
---

1) Edit and modify the properties file jircd.properties as appropriate.
2) Edit and modify the script jircd.cmd as appropriate.
3) Execute the jircd script.
Alternative: run as a JMX agent
3) Execute the agent script.


Command plugins
---------------

All IRC commands are implemented as plugins.
jIRCd provides the following plugins:
 * irc.jar - standard RFC commands
 * irc_p10.jar - Undernet P10 server-server protocol commands
 * ircx.jar - Microsoft's IRCX commands
 * misc.jar - miscellaneous commands (LOCALE)
 * bnc.jar - Bouncer

You can also write your own plugins to customize the existing IRC commands to your requirements,
or even create new custom IRC commands.
See the Javadocs for the jircd.irc.Command interface.


IRC servlets
------------

IRC servlets provide an implementation of the Servlet API for the IRC protocol.
Their design is (not surprisingly) similar to HTTP servlets (which we all know and love).
They provide a framework for implementing IRC services such as nickserv and chanserv.


Security
--------

When running under a security manager, jIRCd supports permissions per IRC command,
and the default plugins support permissions per CTCP message types.
To allow all IRC commands you need to grant the permission:
   permission jircd.irc.CommandPermission "*";
To allow all CTCP message types you need to grant the permission:
   permission jircd.irc.CTCPPermission "*", "*";
The current security policy can be reloaded using the REHASH command.

Examples:
   permission jircd.irc.CommandPermission "PRIVMSG";
      allow the PRIVMSG IRC command
   permission jircd.irc.CTCPPermission "TIME";
      allow the CTCP TIME message
   permission jircd.irc.CTCPPermission "DCC", "*";
      allow all DCC messages
   permission jircd.irc.CTCPPermission "DCC", "CHAT";
      allow the DCC CHAT message


Notes
-----

The motd.txt and INFO.txt files are used by the MOTD and INFO IRC commands, respectively.

IRC operators have the rights to change user and channel modes.


TO DO
-----

PropertiesLoginModule and ConnectionCallback support for IP/host matching and sha/md5.
Server-to-server connections work but are not fully implemented
(basic messaging works).
Disconnection code for servers.
SelectorListener abit buggy.
???Refactor Command interface invoke(Connection, Message)???

Some commands that still need to be added:
TRACE
WHOWAS
