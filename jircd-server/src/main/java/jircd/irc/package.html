Provides the basic IRC server framework.

<h2>Framework</h2>

<p>Listener objects listen on ports for connecting clients.
When a connection is accepted a new Connection object is spawned
together with a Handler to handle I/O for that connection.
Received text lines are parsed into Message objects using a MessageFactory.
The Message object is then passed to the jIRCdMBean to invoke the appropriate
Command object.
Messages are sent in reply by passing them to an Entity.send() method.</p>
